4.LITERATURE REVIEW:   
The stock market has long been a focal point for investors, analysts, and 
researchers, especially within the rapidly evolving landscape of the streaming 
industry. This literature review explores existing research related to stock 
performance analysis, competitive dynamics in the streaming sector, and the 
role of data analytics tools like Excel and Power BI in enhancing financial 
analysis. 
1. Stock Market Analysis and Valuation Techniques 
Research on stock market analysis emphasizes various methodologies for 
evaluating stock performance. Traditional approaches often utilize 
fundamental analysis, which focuses on financial metrics such as earnings, 
revenue, and P/E ratios to determine a company's intrinsic value (Graham & 
Dodd, 2008). Technical analysis, on the other hand, examines historical price 
movements and trading volumes to predict future stock behavior (Murphy, 
1999). Both approaches can be enhanced through the use of advanced data 
analytics tools, which provide deeper insights into market trends and investor 
sentiment. 
2. Streaming Industry Dynamics 
The streaming industry has attracted significant academic interest, particularly 
regarding competitive strategies and market positioning. Research by Lobato 
(2019) highlights how Netflix pioneered the direct-to-consumer model and 
disrupted traditional media. The company's strategy of investing heavily in 
original content has been a focal point in several studies, showing its impact 
on subscriber growth and market share (Elberse, 2013). Comparative studies 
7   
indicate that Netflix's competitive advantage lies in its extensive content 
library and personalized recommendation algorithms (Gomez-Uribe & Hunt, 
2015). This competitive landscape has intensified with the entry of major 
players like Disney and Amazon, prompting analyses of how these companies 
position themselves in the market (Morrison, 2020). 

4.2 Key Concepts and Theories 
Several key concepts and theories form the foundation of stock market 
analysis, guiding investors in their decision-making processes: 
• Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH): 
The Efficient Market Hypothesis posits that stock prices fully reflect all 
available information at any given time. According to this theory, it is 
impossible to consistently achieve higher returns than the overall market 
through stock selection or market timing, as any new information is quickly 
assimilated into stock prices. EMH is categorized into three forms: weak, 
semi-strong, and strong, depending on the types of information considered. 
While EMH provides a framework for understanding market behavior, it has 
also been subject to criticism, particularly in light of market anomalies and 
behavioral finance insights. 
• Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT): 
Developed by Harry Markowitz, MPT emphasizes the importance of 
diversification in optimizing investment portfolios. The theory asserts that an 
investor can reduce overall risk by combining various assets that do not 
perfectly correlate with one another. MPT introduces the concept of the 
"efficient frontier," which represents the optimal risk-return trade-off for a 
given portfolio. Investors can use MPT principles to construct portfolios that 
align with their risk tolerance while maximizing potential returns. 
These theories provide valuable frameworks for analyzing stock market 
behavior and guiding investment strategies. By understanding these concepts, 
investors can enhance their ability to navigate the complexities of the financial 
markets. 

5.EXISTING SYSTEM:   
11   
Current Systems for Stock Market Analysis 
The existing systems for stock market analysis and financial performance 
evaluation predominantly rely on traditional methods. These approaches often 
involve manual processes, basic analytical tools, and fragmented data sources,

reports, and stock market databases for data collection. The diversity of 
sources can lead to inconsistencies, as information may vary from one 
platform to another. 
• Limitations: The manual nature of data collection can result in delays in 
obtaining the most current information, which can be critical for making 
timely investment decisions. Moreover, errors in data entry or selection can 
skew analysis results, leading to misguided conclusions.
